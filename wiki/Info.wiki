You'll find here information about the new version of Delcampe's API, using SOAP technology, standards XML notifications, and providing more info and documentation to you, developers.

The goal of Delcampe's API is to provide an automatic way to manage your items on Delcampe's website. So, the API is for big sellers who have a lot of items on sale on the website.

= API client on .net =

If you intend to call a PHP SOAP server from a .NET Client, there are a couple of things to be aware of. First of all, I've only got it working in WSDL mode. If anyone have made it work in non-WSDL-mode, I'd be interested in hearing that. In WSDL-mode it works, but both input and output-parameters are wrapped from .NET.

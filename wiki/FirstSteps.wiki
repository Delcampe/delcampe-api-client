 * Using our documentation and examples, you should try to call a basic API function : [getServerTime](). Doing so, you'll be able to check if everything is ok on your side. This function does not require any authentication.
 * To access the other functions of our API, you need an API key (contact our customer service to get one)
 * Once you have your API key, you'll be authorized to call any API function you want, regarding your credentials. You could begin by calling [addItemAuction]() or [addItemFixedPrice]() to insert items on the website.

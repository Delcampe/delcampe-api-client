  * Using the documentation and examples, you should try to call a basic API function : [getServerTime](getServerTime.md)(). Doing so, you'll be able to check if everything is ok on your side. This simple function does not require any authentication.

  * To access the other functions of the Delcampe API, you need an API key ([contact](Contact#Contact_Delcampe.md) the Delcampe customer service to get one)

  * Once you have your API key, you'll be authorized to call any API function you need, regarding your credentials. You could begin by calling [addItemAuction](addItemAuction.md)() or [addItemFixedPrice](addItemFixedPrice.md)() to insert items on the website for example.
